No turismo, a transformação digital assume um papel central, contribuindo para a divulgação dos produtos e serviços turísticos, permitindo que os stakeholders e turistas usufruam dos benefícios da globalização e das mudanças sociais. O turismo sénior é considerado um sector em forte expansão e, como tal, importa compreender a importância que estes turistas atribuem a estas tecnologias. Através de uma pesquisa na base de dados b-on e ScienceDirect, foram analisados artigos em texto integral, filtrando-os em várias etapas de forma a selecionar somente os que cumpriam os critérios de inclusão. A presente revisão sistemática de literatura ambiciona contribuir para a compreensão da utilização que os turistas seniores fazem das TIC. Em resultado deste processo, foi possível constatar a tendência crescente do recurso às TIC pelos turistas seniores, que se beneficiam de novas experiências. As TIC potenciam o marketing dos stakeholders, melhoram a comunicação com os turistas e promovem destinos turísticos mais sustentáveis e inteligentes, incluindo as mais inovadoras como a realidade aumentada.},

Procurando preencher esta lacuna, o objetivo deste trabalho é compreender a formação da ETI na perspectiva do viajante. Ele tem caráter exploratório-qualitativo empregando a análise de conteúdo nas opiniões de 76 respondentes. Como resultado, observa-se que a ETI se manifesta no aspecto tecnológico, mas também em respostas cognitivas, comportamentais, sociais e emocionais. A autopersonalização é percebida como um processo autônomo, em que o viajante busca informações e soluções sem esperar por ofertas customizadas. Esse esforço cognitivo é caracterizado por interações sociais geradoras de estados de autonomia e bem-estar que favorecem o apego ao lugar, o e-WOM e o engajamento do viajante nas redes sociais e canais de comunicação de conteúdo próprio das organizações do turismo. O trabalho apresenta como contribuição a formulação de proposições para pesquisas futuras fundamentadas nas relações descobertas na análise dos dados e sinaliza que a confiança possa ser uma variável auxiliar para o entendimento desse fenômeno no contexto da teoria das trocas sociais.

Em Curitiba, os estabelecimentos comerciais de souvenirs se localizam próximos aos principais atrativos turísticos da cidade, contribuindo as experiências dos visitantes. Entende-se que os estabelecimentos comerciais de souvenirs são espaços onde os turistas podem viver diversas experiências. Para esta investigação, considerou-se as quatro dimensões da experiência de Pine II e Gilmore (1999), a saber: aprendizagem, estética, evasão e entretenimento. O objetivo da pesquisa foi analisar como os estabelecimentos comerciais de souvenirs afetam as experiências turísticas em Curitiba-PR. A investigação teve caráter qualitativo, exploratório, consistindo em um estudo aplicado. O instrumento de pesquisa foi estabelecido conforme a abordagem do Design Thinking. Para a realização do estudo foi necessária uma pesquisa bibliográfica, em seguida, foi realizado o trabalho de campo, estabelecendo-se como recorte espacial, o circuito da Linha Turismo. Para a realização do shadowing, foram definidos dezessete pontos comerciais de souvenirs, com características distintas e representativas dos atrativos a elas associadas. Após a análise dos dados por meio de emparelhamento teórico, verificou-se que o ponto de venda e o ambiente dos estabelecimentos comerciais, assim como o atendimento e os produtos ofertados contribuem para as experiências dos turistas.},

O presente artigo tem por objetivo analisar as emoções relacionadas aos atrativos turísticos de Antonina, um pequeno município localizado no litoral do estado do Paraná (Brasil), segundo os conceitos da Economia da Experiência e as emoções sentidas durante o consumo. Para tal, foram codificadas e classificadas as mensagens postadas no website TripAdvisor por algumas pessoas que visitaram Antonina, segundo as listas de emoções e sentimentos propostas por Richins (1997), Laros e Steenkamp (2005) e Pine II e Gilmore (1999). Como resultado se constatou que o município possui principalmente atrativos indicados para pessoas que visam à contemplação, devido aos recursos paisagísticos e alguns locais que oferecem tranquilidade e relaxamento, ou ainda para aqueles que buscam entretenimento fotografando paisagens. Em menor número foram verificados atrativos que atendem às expectativas daqueles que buscam estímulo e entusiasmo por meio de atividades de aventura},

No entanto, a mensuração dessa dimensão ainda é recente e restrita em relação a sua aplicabilidade. Diversos autores elaboraram escalas que medem a experiência de consumo no contexto das marcas, eventos esportivos e eventos turísticos. Os eventos podem ser utilizados como meio de promoção das experiências porque os consumidores têm a chance de se envolver em atividades que não são possíveis nas suas vidas diárias. O evento objeto de estudo do presente trabalho é a Virada Cultural 2014 de Belo Horizonte, evento cultural realizado pela segunda vez consecutiva na capital mineira durante um final de semana. O estudo buscou compreender as experiências dos participantes da Virada Cultural a partir de uma escala de experiência memorável turística elaborada e testada em outro trabalho. Para isso, foi realizada uma pesquisa de caráter descritivo com uma abordagem quantitativa por meio a aplicação de um survey durante o evento. Os principais resultados foram (1) a dimensão hedonismo foi a mais impactante para Experiência Memorável e a Cultura Local como a menos impactante; (2) a  relação positiva e significante entre Experiência Memorável e satisfação e (3) a relação positiva e significante entre Satisfação e Intenção de Retorno nas próximas edições e a Recomendação boca a boca para pessoas próximas.},

While academic studies are increasingly examining tourism as a function of memorable experiences (ME), more research most be done to uncover the essence of what exactly makes certain experiences special, spectacular, and fittingly, memorable. This study sought to explore the essence of MEs based on research from the field of psychology, with a view to understanding the cognitive processes that impede individuals from paying attention to their experiences, as well as the conceptual processes of memory formation and retention. In-depth interviews revealed four key dimensions of MEs: affect, expectations, consequentiality and recollection.

Last count reveals that there are more than ten high-tech companies offering products for text mining. Has text mining evolved so rapidly to become a mature field? This article attempts to shed some lights to the question. We first present a text mining framework consisting of two components: Text refining that transforms unstructured text documents into an intermediate form; and knowledge distillation that deduces patterns or knowledge from the intermediate form. We then survey the state-of-the-art text mining products/applications and align them based on the text refining and knowledge distillation functions as well as the intermediate form that they adopt. In conclusion, we highlight the upcoming challenges of text mining and the opportunities it offers.},

This keen nature of humanity has emerged as a new field of analysis that is social data analysis. The Internet has merged the world today and as a result, human social circles have expanded. There are various peculiar social networking sites available on the internet, some of them are on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and many more. Each maintains accounts of billions of active users and the huge amount of data is being produced as a result of interactions over such sites. Hence analyzing this data is a tedious task. But analysis of such online social communities and predicting their behavior is of great importance for businesses and academics. In this paper, we are concentrating more on twitter.

   abstract = {s Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases have been attracting a significant amount of research, industry, and media attention of late. What is all the excitement about? This article provides an overview of this emerging field, clarifying how data mining and knowledge discovery in databases are related both to each other and to related fields, such as machine learning, statistics, and databases. The article mentions particular real-world applications, specific data-mining techniques, challenges involved in real-world applications of knowledge discovery, and current and future research directions in the field. A cross a wide variety of fields, data are being collected and accumulated at a dramatic pace. There is an urgent need for a new generation of computational theories and tools to assist humans in extracting useful information (knowledge) from the rapidly growing volumes of digital data. These theories and tools are the subject of the emerging field of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). At an abstract level, the KDD field is concerned with the development of methods and techniques for making sense of data. The basic problem addressed by the KDD process is one of mapping low-level data (which are typically too voluminous to understand and digest easily) into other forms that might be more compact (for example, a short report), more abstract (for example, a descriptive approximation or model of the process that generated the data), or more useful (for example , a predictive model for estimating the value of future cases). At the core of the process is the application of specific data-mining methods for pattern discovery and extraction. 1 This article begins by discussing the historical context of KDD and data mining and their intersection with other related fields. A brief summary of recent KDD real-world applications is provided. Definitions of KDD and data mining are provided, and the general mul-tistep KDD process is outlined. This multistep process has the application of data-mining algorithms as one particular step in the process. The data-mining step is discussed in more detail in the context of specific data-mining algorithms and their application. Real-world practical application issues are also outlined. Finally, the article enumerates challenges for future research and development and in particular discusses potential opportunities for AI technology in KDD systems. Why Do We Need KDD? The traditional method of turning data into knowledge relies on manual analysis and interpretation. For example, in the health-care industry, it is common for specialists to periodically analyze current trends and changes in health-care data, say, on a quarterly basis. The specialists then provide a report detailing the analysis to the sponsoring health-care organization ; this report becomes the basis for future decision making and planning for health-care management. In a totally different type of application, planetary geologists sift through remotely sensed images of planets and asteroids, carefully locating and cataloging such geologic objects of interest as impact craters. Be it science, marketing, finance, health care, retail, or any other field, the classical approach to data analysis relies fundamentally on one or more analysts becoming Articles},

Com o objetivo de orientar novos pesquisadores da área sobre o estado da arte da mineração de opiniões através de técnicas de aprendizado de máquina, este trabalho apresenta um levantamento do uso das técnicas de aprendizado supervisionado que são mais úteis na definição de modelos para a classificação de opiniões. Este estudo considera também os métodos empregados para a seleção de caracterís-ticas e compara a acurácia dos diversos algoritmos discutidos. Além disso, são descritas algumas aplicações que empregam esses algoritmos em diferentes áreas de conhecimento.

   abstract = {O turismo de cassinos é o tema da presente investigação, cujo recorte espacial contempla a região do Destino Turístico Iguaçu, na tríplice fronteira entre Brasil, Paraguai e Argentina, que oferta jogos de apostas como um de seus produtos. Neste contexto, a pesquisa contribui para reduzir uma lacuna existente na literatura sobre turismo de cassinos no Brasil, buscando entender as motivações dos fluxos para estes atrativos a partir da perspectiva do turista, visto que os estudos sobre o turismo na região se concentram nos atrativos mais relevantes como as Cataratas, e que, os cassinos foram mais estudados enquanto fatos históricos. Assim, propõem-se como objetivo geral, identificar os fatores motivacionais que levam os turistas a visitar os cassinos do Destino Turístico Iguaçu. A metodologia utilizada foi de natureza qualitativa e documental tendo como fonte de dados comentários de turistas na plataforma TripAdvisor. A captura dos comentários ocorreu com o uso de um software em Python, obtendo-se uma amostra de 2.197 comentários em língua portuguesa, contemplando o período entre agosto de 2012 e março de 2020. A tabulação e o processamento dos dados foi realizado com mecanismos para análise de textos do software R, que gerou um conjunto de quadrigramas (sequências de quatro palavras), de forma que, foi possível catalogar os fatores motivacionais que emergiram do corpus analisado. Aplicando análise de conteúdo, os quadrigramas foram classificados nas categorias motivacionais do modelo bidimensional push e pull. Observou-se que as motivações que mais incentivam o turista a frequentar os cassinos (push) se concentram nos fatores "novidade", seguido de "socialização" e "repouso e relaxamento". No que tange às características que atraem os turistas para os cassinos (pull) aparecem os fatores "infraestrutura", seguido de "bares e entretenimento" e "acomodações e transporte". Esse resultado é consonante com outros estudos realizados com a mesma metodologia em destinos com cassinos nos Estados Unidos, Europa e Ásia. No que tange a contribuição prática do estudo, destaca-se a oportunidade de ampliar estratégias de integração do atrativo cassino aos demais atrativos existentes na região, aumentando a permanência do turista. Como contribuição acadêmica, colabora para reduzir uma lacuna existente na pesquisa brasileira, somando-se a estudos internacionais que abordam o turismo de cassino como produto e não apenas como elemento histórico, num contexto, em que o destino não está limitado por fronteiras político-administrativas, mas sim, pela movimentação do turista no espaço.},

   abstract = {Resumo O tema da presente pesquisa consiste na análise da experiência dos visitantes em atrativos turísticos localizados no Parque Estadual do Jalapão (PEJ), situado no estado de Tocantins (TO), região norte do Brasil. O objetivo geral do plano de trabalho foi identificar a qualidade da experiência percebida pelo turista ao visitar a Serra do Espírito Santo, um dos atrativos do parque, tendo como base teórica os princípios da economia da experiência, que propõe entender a relação de consumo a partir de quatro domínios: entretenimento, educação/aprendizagem, evasão/fuga e estética/contemplação. Esta investigação, quanto à extensão de aprofundamento do problema, se caracteriza como pesquisa exploratória, na medida em que proporciona ao investigador assimilar os meandros do tema discutido. Quanto à abordagem de coleta e tratamento de dados, concentra-se na forma qualitativa, pois se caracteriza como um processo investigativo não-estruturado, que possibilita ao pesquisador examinar um tema de maneira a compreender o contexto em que o fenômeno ocorre. No que se refere a forma de discutir os dados, possui o caráter descritivo, tendo em vista que busca construir o panorama de uma situação, evento, pessoa, ou mesmo, demonstrar de que maneira os objetos de estudo estão relacionados entre si. Nesse sentido, a pesquisa se enquadra como exploratória, qualitativa e descritiva, pois tem por objetivo descrever as características da experiência, analisando os comentários sobre a Serra do Espírito Santo, postados pelos turistas, na plataforma do TripAdvisor, cujas etapas são descritas a seguir. O procedimento metodológico, para o exame do texto, seguiu os preceitos da Análise de Conteúdo. Como ferramenta para sistematização dos textos, utilizou-se técnicas de análise textual contidas em pacotes do software R, gerando um conjunto de tetragramas que foram interpretados e organizados conforme os conceitos dos domínios de experiência. Os tetragramas com sentido recreativo foram classificados na dimensão do entretenimento, já os que demonstravam dicas ou informações, foram classificados na dimensão aprendizagem, pois agregavam algum conhecimento. Os relatos que remetem a sensação de contemplação foram reunidos na dimensão da estética, e a fuga da realidade ou a transcendência compuseram o conjunto de relatos na dimensão escapismo. Constatou-se, pela concentração dos tetragramas, que a Serra do Espírito Santo é mais percebida pela sua Estética (35%), seguida pela Aprendizagem (31%) e pelo Entretenimento (28%), apresentando pouca variação entre elas. O Escapismo é o domínio menos evidenciado, com apenas 6% dos tetragramas classificados nesta dimensão. Observa-se, porém, que o atrativo tem potencial para ajudar os viajantes a quebrar o ciclo da rotina e transportá-los para uma outra realidade no momento da visita. Assim, a Serra do Espírito Santo necessita melhorar a dimensão do Escapismo para propiciar uma experiência memorável. O contato com a natureza pode fazer o viajante repensar seus valores e prioridades e levá-lo a uma reflexão mais apurada sobre esse assunto, viabilizando essa melhoria.},

   abstract = {Resumo O objetivo geral do estudo foi identificar a qualidade da experiência obtida pelo turista ao visitar o atrativo turístico Fervedouro do Ceiça com base nos comentários do TripAdvisor. Este fervedouro é um dos principais atrativos do Parque Estadual do Jalapão (PEJ), no Tocantins. No que diz respeito ao design da investigação, a pesquisa se caracteriza como exploratória quanto aos seus objetivos, qualitativa quanto à abordagem e se fundamenta em fontes de dados bibliográficos e documentais. No que tange a apresentação e discussão dos dados obtidos se caracteriza como descritiva. A interpretação dos dados foi realizada tomando-se os fundamentos da economia da experiência. Os procedimentos de coleta e tratamento dos dados, seguiram os seguintes passos. Coletou-se o conjunto de comentários sobre o Fervedouro do Ceiça disponíveis na plataforma TripAdvisor, os quais foram processados utilizando-se ferramentas do software R. Após o processamento, foram obtidos 237 tetragramas (sequências de quatro palavras) que foram classificados conforme os domínios da experiência, que são: contemplação, evasão, entretenimento e aprendizagem. Após a classificação dos tetragramas, calculou-se o percentual de citações que cada uma das dimensões obteve em relação ao total, a fim de poder comparar os resultados. Nesse caso, o entretenimento teve 49% dos tetragramas, indicando que a maioria dos comentários revela que os indivíduos obtêm uma participação passiva apenas se divertindo no local. A segunda dimensão foi a da aprendizagem com 23%, evidenciando que ao usufruir do atrativo os turistas aprendem algo. Em virtude de ser um ambiente natural e pela própria estrutura dos fervedouros a paisagem chama atenção dos turistas, fazendo com que a contemplação obtivesse 18% dos tetragramas. Por fim, a evasão, ou o desprendimento emocional do indivíduo que comentou sua experiência no TripAdvisor aparece em 10% dos tetragramas. Assim, entende-se que há possibilidade de realizar ações para promover uma experiência mais completa e inesquecível no atrativo Fervedouro do Ceiça, incrementando a experiência dos turistas nas dimensões aprendizagem, estética e evasão, já que quase metade dos comentários indicam que o turista apenas se diverte no fervedouro.},

   abstract = {O turismo constitui-se num fenômeno complexo, visto sob diferentes perspectivas, sendo que a experiência integra o que é denominado de atividade turística. Sob o prisma econômico, envolve uma relação de consumo, cujo entendimento pode ser alcançado a partir de quatro domínios, sendo eles entretenimento, educação/aprendizagem, estética/contemplação e evasão/escapismo. O objeto do presente estudo envolve o Parque Estadual do Jalapão (PEJ), localizado no Estado de Tocantins, região norte do Brasil. O objetivo desta pesquisa situa-se em identificar quais domínios de experiências, daqueles propostos por Pine e Gilmore (1999), emergem dos comentários dos turistas sobre o Parque Estadual do Jalapão. O estudo se caracteriza como de abordagem qualitativa, cujos dados foram extraídos dos comentários da plataforma TripAdvisor, os quais foram posteriormente analisados sob o prisma da teoria dos domínios de experiência, com uso da análise de conteúdo. Os resultados permitem concluir que os turistas que visitam o PEJ tendem a ter experiências passivas e de absorção no local. Constata-se que inúmeras narrativas do trade turístico apontam o PEJ como um destino de ecoturismo. Nesse caso, observou-se que o domínio da aprendizagem foi o que obteve a menor proporção de citações pelos turistas, sugerindo que a educação ambiental, um dos pilares do turismo ecológico, não foi tema muito recorrente nos comentários postados na plataforma analisada. Por fim, entende-se que a concepção metodológica da pesquisa pode se constituir numa importante ferramenta para o estudo do turismo e possibilitar aprofundamentos teóricos e melhorias da oferta de produtos do ecoturismo no PEJ.},

Este artigo apresenta uma abordagem para a avaliação dos domínios da experiência para o Parque Estadual do Jalapão, Brasil, a partir dos comentários postados na plataforma Tripadvisor. A interpretação foi realizada empregando-se a netnografia combinada com recursos de análise de conteúdo utilizando o software R. Os atrativos foram avaliados e classificados considerando as experiências relatadas. Concluiu-se que individualmente os atrativos sofrem variações no que tange aos domínios da experiência, sendo que as Dunas foi o lugar que obteve a melhor classificação e o povoado de Mumbuca a pior. Todavia, no conjunto do destino, pelos comentários do turista, verifica-se que o mesmo admite usufruir de uma experiência memorável. Assim, a abordagem apresentada contribuiu para a identificação de lacunas para iniciativas públicas e privadas que possibilitem o atendimento das expectativas dos turistas, tornando o Jalapão mais competitivo e viável na perspectiva do desenvolvimento sustentável.},

The increasing number of means of transportation has an impact on the intense competition between these types of businesses. The level of customer satisfaction is a vital aspect to survive and win business competition, one way of measuring customer satisfaction is by providing easy and convenient access for customers to submit suggestions, criticisms, opinions, and complaints. Along with the development of online media, customer reviews can be created and viewed by many people through social media. This study uses web scraping techniques to obtain Garuda Indonesia airline reviews data from the TripAdvisor site. Data obtained from the TripAdvisor site is further labeled and analyzed using the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) method to classify reviews based on positive and negative sentiment categories. Furthermore, the results of sentiment classification will be analyzed by Text Mining method, the main concept is to do the widest exploration in the data of the reviews that have been obtained so that it is found an information that is considered important and can be useful for various areas of need. Sentiment classification results show more than 80% of the reviews are positive reviews with an accuracy of 82.02%. From the text association results obtained information that passengers of Garuda Indonesia majority share talk about the service, staff, seat, and food because it always appears in both positive and negative sentiment class.

   abstract = {The opinions and feelings expressed by tourists in their reviews intuitively represent tourists' evaluation of travel destinations with distinct tones and strong emotions. Both consumers and product/service providers need help understanding and navigating the resulting information spaces, which are vast and dynamic. Traditional sentiment analysis is mostly based on statistics, which can analyze the sentiment of a large number of texts. However, it is difficult to classify the overall sentiment of a text, and the context-independent nature limits their representative power in a rich context, hurting performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This work proposes an aspect-based sentiment analysis model by extracting aspect-category and corresponding sentiment polarity from tourists' reviews, based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model. First, we design a text enhancement strategy which utilizes iterative translation across multiple languages, to generate a dataset of 4,000 reviews by extending a dataset of 2,000 online reviews on 1,000 tourist attractions. Then, the enhanced dataset is reorganized into 10 classifications by the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method. Finally, the aspect-based sentiment analysis is performed on the enhanced dataset, and the obtained sentiment polarity classification and prediction of the tourism review data make the expectations and appeals in tourists' language available. The experimental study generates generic and personalized recommendations for users based on the emotions in the language and helps merchants achieve more effective service and product upgrades.},

Analysis of variance was used to extract the unique and common features of the image of each city analysed. The results showed that Riga and Gdansk have the largest number of unique features/attributes, while Kaliningrad has the smallest. Positive and negative sentiment analysis indicated that Gdansk and Szczecin have a higher proportion of positive sentiment in reviews than Riga and Kaliningrad.

Taking online tourism reviews from TripAdvisor and Google Maps for El Cajas National Park in Ecuador as a case study, we propose a novel approach to develop a crowdsourced phrasal lexicon for eight CES. After applying the lexicon to the texts, we filtered CES-positive reviews to find that TripAdvisor showed higher CES frequencies based on greater verbosity than Google Maps, while Google Maps contained more non-English reviews to represent Spanish-speaking users. The frequency of CES showed little difference for aesthetic value, yet English reviews outperformed in describing biological and recreational values whereas Spanish reviews excelled in describing spiritual values. Cross-linguistic comparisons of frequent phrases further elaborated different expressions in describing CES. We confirmed the applicability of crowdsourced phrasal lexicon to comprehend CES with higher context, despite the limitations from tourism-inclined contents. Overall, understanding site-specific CES can enable the implementation of data-driven conservation strategies in global protected areas.},

Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online.

Several approaches in sentiment analysis are based on machine learning techniques, more specifically classifiers that are trained on labeled datasets. In this context, many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks are usually employed as a preprocessing step to help improve the quality of the data and to convert them into forms appropriate for the subsequent classification process. Several studies on sentiment analysis in the literature have already performed some evaluation of NLP tasks and/or classification. However, the vast majority of them did not work with texts in the Brazilian Portuguese language and the analyzes did not consider the combination of sets of preprocessing tasks with classifiers. Therefore, in this work, we evaluate the combination of five NLP tasks and three classifiers in the domain of sentiment analysis using texts written in Portuguese. The experimental results showed that different combinations of preprocessing tasks can significantly affect the predictive performance of a classifier for a given dataset. Thus, it is clear the importance of performing the joint evaluation of preprocessing tasks with classifiers when choosing which preprocessing tasks and classifiers should be used for a dataset.},

Thus, a great amount of applications has arisen to explore this knowledge through automatic sentiment and opinion extraction. The technique known as Sentiment Analysis (SA) aims to analyze opinions, sentiments, and emotions present in unstructured data, leading many papers to address the impact of news and social media publications on the financial market. However, the literature lacks works considering the effects of sentiment available on social media and its impacts on the Brazilian stock market. This work aims to conduct a study of the Brazilian stock market movement through SA in Twitter considering tree perspectives: (i) absolute number of tweet sentiments; (ii) tweets sentiments weighted by favorites; and (iii) tweets sentiments weighted by retweets. The analyzed period was the Brazilian electoral period of 2018 (01-Oct-2018 to 31-Dec-2018). In this paper, we first developed a comparison study with SA Machine Learning techniques (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Maximum Entropy, and Multilayer Perceptron) and then applied the best algorithm to establish the relations between sentiments and the Brazilian stock market movement considering different time frames (windows sizes). Results indicate that Multilayer Perceptron was the best technique to perform SA in Portuguese. In addition, we observed that the predominant sentiment in social media relates to the stock market movement, improving accuracy as long as windows sizes are increased.},

   abstract = {With the growth and popularity of the internet and more specifically of social net- works, users can more easily share their thoughts, insights and experiences with others. Messages shared via social networks provide useful information for several applications, such as monitoring specific targets for sentiment or comparing the public sentiment on several targets, avoiding the traditional marketing research method with the use of sur- veys to explicitly get the public opinion. To extract information from the large amounts of messages that are shared, it is best to use an automated program to process these mes- sages. Sentiment analysis is an automated process to determine the sentiment expressed in natural language in text. Sentiment is a broad term, but here we are focussed in opinions and emotions that are expressed in text. Nowadays, out of the existing social network websites, Twitter is considered the best one for this kind of analysis. Twitter allows users to share their opinion on several topics and entities, by means of short messages. The messages may be malformed and contain spelling errors, therefore some treatment of the text may be necessary before the analysis, such as spell checks. To know what the message is focusing on it is necessary to find these entities on the text such as people, locations, organizations, products, etc. and then analyse the rest of the text and obtain what is said about that specific entity. With the analysis of several messages, we can have a general idea on what the public thinks regarding many different entities. It is our goal to extract as much information concerning different entities from tweets in the Portuguese language. Here it is shown different techniques that may be used as well as examples and results on state-of-the-art related work. Using a semantic approach, from these messages we were able to find and extract named entities and assigning sen- timent values for each found entity, producing a complete tool competitive with existing solutions. The sentiment classification and assigning to entities is based on the grammat- ical construction of the message. These results are then used to be viewed by the user in real time or stored to be viewed latter. This analysis provides ways to view and compare the public sentiment regarding these entities, showing the favourite brands, companies and people, as well as showing the growth of the sentiment over time.},

The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or other languages) in Markdown documents. In fact, knitr supported sev- eral authoring languages from the beginning in addition to Markdown, in- cluding LaTeX, HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, andTextile. Looking back over the five years, it seems to be fair to say that Markdown has become the most popular document format, which is what we expected. The simplicity of Markdown clearly stands out among these document formats. However, the original version of Markdown invented by John Gruber1 was often found overly simple and not suitable to write highly technical docu- ments. For example, there was no syntax for tables, footnotes, math expres- sions, or citations. Fortunately, John MacFarlane created a wonderful pack- age named Pandoc (http://pandoc.org) to convert Markdown documents (and many other types of documents) to a large variety of output formats. More importantly, the Markdown syntax was significantly enriched. Now we can write more types of elements with Markdown while still enjoying its simplicity. In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).},

   abstract = {If you work in analytics or data science, like we do, you are familiar with the fact that data is being generated all the time at ever faster rates. (You may even be a little weary of people pontificating about this fact.) Analysts are often trained to handle tabular or rectangular data that is mostly numeric, but much of the data proliferating today is unstructured and text-heavy. Many of us who work in analytical fields are not trained in even simple interpretation of natural language. We developed the tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016) R package because we were familiar with many methods for data wrangling and visualization, but couldn’t easily apply these same methods to text. We found that using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use. Treating text as data frames of individual words allows us to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text easily and integrate natural language processing into effective workflows we were already using. This book serves as an introduction of text mining using the tidytext package and other tidy tools in R. The functions provided by the tidytext package are relatively simple; what is important are the possible applications. Thus, this book provides compelling examples of real text mining problems. Outline We start by introducing the tidy text format, and some of the ways dplyr, tidyr, and tidytext allow informative analyses of this structure. Chapter 1 outlines the tidy text format and the unnest_tokens() function. It also introduces the gutenbergr and janeaustenr packages, which provide useful literary text datasets that we’ll use throughout this book. Chapter 2 shows how to perform sentiment analysis on a tidy text dataset, using the sentiments dataset from tidytext and inner_join() from dplyr. Chapter 3 describes the tf-idf statistic (term frequency times inverse document frequency), a quantity used for identifying terms that are especially important to a particular document. Chapter 4 introduces n-grams and how to analyze word networks in text using the widyr and ggraph packages. Text won’t be tidy at all stages of an analysis, and it is important to be able to convert back and forth between tidy and non-tidy formats. Chapter 5 introduces methods for tidying document-term matrices and corpus objects from the tm and quanteda packages, as well as for casting tidy text datasets into those formats. Chapter 6 explores the concept of topic modeling, and uses the tidy() method to interpret and visualize the output of the topicmodels package. We conclude with several case studies that bring together multiple tidy text mining approaches we’ve learned. Chapter 7 demonstrates an application of a tidy text analysis by analyzing the authors’ own Twitter archives. How do Dave’s and Julia’s tweeting habits compare? Chapter 8 explores metadata from over 32,000 NASA datasets (available in JSON) by looking at how keywords from the datasets are connected to title and description fields. Chapter 9 analyzes a dataset of Usenet messages from a diverse set of newsgroups (focused on topics like politics, hockey, technology, atheism, and more) to understand patterns across the groups.},

Os resultados mostram que temas envolvendo práticas, processos, sistemas de GC e tecnologias de informação são recorrentemente encontrados tanto em resumos de artigos nacionais como internacionais. Por outro lado, de maneira geral, os artigos nacionais se distinguem pelo fato de apresentarem termos mais associados a aspectos abstratos da GC (modelos, conhecimento tácito e organizacional), enquanto que os internacionais caracterizam-se por termos mais pragmáticos (efetividade, implementação, relacionamentos e desenvolvimento).Since its introduction in the mid-1980s, the theme 'Knowledge Management' (KM) has been approached under different aspects.

The results show that themes involving practices, processes, KM systems and information technologies are recurrently found in both article summaries national and international. Furthermore, in general, national articles are distinguished by the fact that they are associated with a more abstract aspects of the KM (models, tacit and organizational knowledge), while international are characterized by a more pragmatic terms (effectiveness, implementation, relationships and development).},

As described by Hadley Wickham (Wick-ham 2014), tidy data has a specific structure: • each variable is a column • each observation is a row • each type of observational unit is a table Tidy data sets allow manipulation with a standard set of " tidy " tools, including popu-lar packages such as dplyr (Wickham, Francois, and RStudio 2015), ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, and RStudio 2016), and broom (Robinson et al. 2015). These tools do not yet, however, have the infrastructure to work fluently with text data and natural language processing tools. In developing this package, we provide functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion of text to and from tidy formats, and to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and existing text mining packages. We define the tidy text format as being one-token-per-document-per-row, and provide functionality to tokenize by commonly used units of text including words, n-grams, and sentences. At the same time, the tidytext package doesn't expect a user to keep text data in a tidy form at all times during an analysis. The package includes functions to tidy objects (see the broom package (Robinson et al. 2015)) from popular text mining R packages such as tm (Ingo Feinerer and Meyer 2008) and quanteda (Benoit and Nulty 2016). This allows, for example, a workflow with easy reading, filtering, and processing to be done using dplyr and other tidy tools, after which the data can be converted into a document-term matrix for machine learning applications. The models can then be re-converted into a tidy form for interpretation and visualization with ggplot2.},

A total of 188 papers about photo-trapping in Mexico were compiled, with 88.2 % published in 50 journals over the past seven years. The main journals were Therya, Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad, Acta Zoologica Mexicana (New Series) and Revista de Biología Tropical. The articles identified were written by 406 co-authors, 28 of whom contributed with 32.4 % of the papers published. A total of 40 species were reported in the title and abstract of these papers; the most frequent species were Panthera onca, Leopardus pardalis, Puma concolor, Tapirus bairdii, Tayassu pecari, Odocoileus virginianus, and Cuniculus paca. Oaxaca, Campeche, Sonora, Chiapas, Guanajuato, and Puebla were the main states where studies were conducted; in particular, most of them were carried out within Biosphere Reserves. Major research topics comprised records that broaden the distribution range, estimates of relative abundance and density, analysis of activity patterns, ecological interactions between species, and use of photo-trapping data as supplementary information to elaborate inventories of species. The analysis of text mining clearly indicates a trend towards an increasing use of photo-trapping in Mexico. Felines, ungulates and various species of the order Carnivora are main subjects of study. Photo-trapping has been used to explore a number of aspects of the biology of animal species. A large number of studies have been carried out in southeastern Mexico. The use of text mining techniques is a practical approach to analyze large volumes of data.},

   abstract = {Text mining has gained big interest both in academic research as in business intelligence applications within the last decade. There is an enormous amount of textual data available in machine readable format which can be easily accessed via the Internet or databases. This ranges from scientific articles, abstracts and books to memos, letters, online forums, mailing lists, blogs, and other communication media delivering sensible information. Text mining is a highly interdisciplinary research field utilizing techniques from computer science, linguistics, and statistics. For the latter R is one of the leading computing environments offering a broad range of statistical methods. However, until recently, R has lacked an explicit framework for text mining purposes. This has changed with the tm (Feinerer, 2008; Feinerer et al., 2008) package which provides a text mining infrastructure for R. This allows R users to work efficiently with texts and corresponding meta data and transform the texts into structured representations where existing R methods can be applied, e.g., for clustering or classification. In this article we will give a short overview of the tm package. Then we will present two exemplary text mining applications, one in the field of stylometry and authorship attribution, the second is an analysis of a mailing list. Our aim is to show that tm provides the necessary abstraction over the actual text management so that the reader can use his own texts for a wide variety of text mining techniques.},

However, we typically face two challenges when analyzing large corpora: (1) the amount of data to be processed in a single machine is usually limited by the available main memory (i.e., RAM), and (2) the more data to be analyzed the higher the need for efficient procedures for calculating valuable results. Fortunately, adequate programming models like MapReduce facilitate parallelization of text mining tasks and allow for processing data sets beyond what would fit into memory by using a distributed file system possibly spanning over several machines, e. g., in a cluster of workstations. In this paper we present a plug-in package to tm called tm.plugin.dc implementing a distributed corpus class which can take advantage of the Hadoop MapReduce library for large scale text mining tasks. We show on the basis of an application in culturomics that we can efficiently handle data sets of significant size.},

   abstract = {If you work in analytics or data science, like we do, you are familiar with the fact that data is being generated all the time at ever faster rates. (You may even be a little weary of people pontificating about this fact.) Analysts are often trained to handle tabular or rectangular data that is mostly numeric, but much of the data proliferating today is unstructured and text-heavy. Many of us who work in analytical fields are not trained in even simple interpretation of natural language. We developed the tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016) R package because we were familiar with many methods for data wrangling and visualization, but couldn’t easily apply these same methods to text. We found that using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use. Treating text as data frames of individual words allows us to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text easily and integrate natural language processing into effective workflows we were already using. This book serves as an introduction of text mining using the tidytext package and other tidy tools in R. The functions provided by the tidytext package are relatively simple; what is important are the possible applications. Thus, this book provides compelling examples of real text mining problems. Outline We start by introducing the tidy text format, and some of the ways dplyr, tidyr, and tidytext allow informative analyses of this structure. Chapter 1 outlines the tidy text format and the unnest_tokens() function. It also introduces the gutenbergr and janeaustenr packages, which provide useful literary text datasets that we’ll use throughout this book. Chapter 2 shows how to perform sentiment analysis on a tidy text dataset, using the sentiments dataset from tidytext and inner_join() from dplyr. Chapter 3 describes the tf-idf statistic (term frequency times inverse document frequency), a quantity used for identifying terms that are especially important to a particular document. Chapter 4 introduces n-grams and how to analyze word networks in text using the widyr and ggraph packages. Text won’t be tidy at all stages of an analysis, and it is important to be able to convert back and forth between tidy and non-tidy formats. Chapter 5 introduces methods for tidying document-term matrices and corpus objects from the tm and quanteda packages, as well as for casting tidy text datasets into those formats. Chapter 6 explores the concept of topic modeling, and uses the tidy() method to interpret and visualize the output of the topicmodels package. We conclude with several case studies that bring together multiple tidy text mining approaches we’ve learned. Chapter 7 demonstrates an application of a tidy text analysis by analyzing the authors’ own Twitter archives. How do Dave’s and Julia’s tweeting habits compare? Chapter 8 explores metadata from over 32,000 NASA datasets (available in JSON) by looking at how keywords from the datasets are connected to title and description fields. Chapter 9 analyzes a dataset of Usenet messages from a diverse set of newsgroups (focused on topics like politics, hockey, technology, atheism, and more) to understand patterns across the groups.},

The extracted sentiment would facilitate better tourist decision making and improve customer service and new product development for tourism enterprises. This study presents a sentiment analysis model to extract the hidden sentiments from tourist reviews about restaurants in Dubai that will guide visitors to the city in taking suitable dining decisions. Sentiment analysis is carried out by extracting tourist reviews about restaurants in Dubai using a web scraping method using text mining techniques with the help of the R statistical software package. The resultant data is further analysed by sentiment analysis tools to extract the hidden sentiments, which are categorized under eight heads. The sentiment analysis helped uncover hidden sentiments along with the frequency of each sentiment category. It also helped to find the difference between tourist sentiment scores with respect to different categories of restaurants.

If researchers could quantify the research topic in terms of its fit with the journal requirements before the submission of a paper, then the assessment of journal suitability could be much easier.

Taking the twelve leading Tourism and Hospitality journals as a reference, the main research topics mentioned in the abstracts of 20,381 articles are identified, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and other text-mining techniques running the R programming language. Subsequently, a quantitative measure of the fit of the research topics in each journal is offered according to their frequency of occurrence. The results suggested that the importance of the topic-journal fit with respect to the impact factor depended on the variance of the fits among the journals. Finally, a guide of the most suitable journals for the topics is presented, based on the JCR impact factor and the fit of the topic.

A word cloud was then generated and the frequently mentioned words are “China”, “like”, “price” “good” and ‘SUV’. In the second case study, we perform sentiment analysis on a total of 5330 comments using SAS Enterprise Miner 14.1. Out of the 60 documents, 39 (65%) posts were positive comments from the public while 21 (35%) posts were negative comments. The frequently mentioned words in the positive documents are “look good”, “buy”, “better” and “nice”. Chi-Square and Information Gain were compared in selecting the meaningful terms of features. The selected features were used to evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in classifying the posts as positive or negative. Five-fold cross validation results showed that SVM using linear kernel function has the highest accuracy (73.3%), sensitivity (76.7%) and F-measure (0.805).},

   abstract = {Business Analytics leverages value from data, thus being an important tool for the decision-making process. However, the presence of data in different formats is a new challenge for analysis. Textual data has been drawing organizational attention as thousands of people express themselves daily in text, like the description of customer perceptions in the tourism and hospitality area. Despite the relevance of customer data in textual format to support decision making of hotel managers, its use is still modest, given the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large amounts of data. Our objective is to identify the main evaluation topics presented in online guest reviews and reveal changes throughout the years. We worked with 23,229 hotel reviews collected from TripAdvisor website through WebScrapping packages in R, and used a text mining approach (Latent Semantic Analysis) to analyze the data. This contributes with practical implications to hotel managers by demonstrating the applicability of text data and tools based on open-source solutions and by providing insights about the data and assisting in the decision-making process. This article also contributes in presenting a stepwise text analysis, including capturing, cleaning and formatting publicly available data for organizational specialists.},

It posits that each text document consists of a group of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words related to it. With the emergence of a plethora of text data, the LDA has become a popular algorithm for topic modeling among researchers from different domains. Therefore, it is essential to understand the trends of LDA researches. Bibliometric techniques are established methods to study the research progress of a topic. In this study, bibliographic data of 18715 publications that have cited the LDA were extracted from the Scopus database. The software R and Vosviewer were used to carry out the analysis. The analysis revealed that research interest in LDA had grown exponentially. The results showed that most authors preferred “Book Series” followed by “Conference Proceedings” as the publication venue. The majority of the institutions and authors were from the USA, followed by China. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords indicated that text mining and machine learning were dominant topics in LDA research with significant interest in social media. This study attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis and intellectual structure of LDA compared to previous studies.},

Great effort is dedicated to analyzing labor demand and supply, and actions are taken at many levels to match one with the other. In this work we concentrate on skills needs, a dynamic variable dependent on many aspects such as geography, time, or the type of industry. Historically, skills in demand were easy to evaluate since transitions in that area were fairly slow, gradual, and easy to adjust to. In contrast, current changes are occurring rapidly and might take an unexpected turn. Therefore, we introduce a relatively simple yet effective method of monitoring skills needs straight from the source—as expressed by potential employers in their job advertisements. We employ open source tools such as RapidMiner and R as well as easily accessible online vacancy data. We demonstrate selected techniques, namely classification with k-NN and information extraction from a textual dataset, to determine effective ways of discovering knowledge from a given collection of vacancies.},

The PRISMA methodology was applied for the literature review; the studies were included using the R software and bibliometric techniques with a general search equation that allowed access to all ITS production in Scopus. Subsequently, with the help of artificial intelligence, text mining was used to identify topics of interest in the scientific community, followed by further filtering. Finally, the selected full texts were analyzed using the NVivo software to extract emerging challenges in the field, obtaining 163 full texts for analysis. Among the main findings, the primary purpose of evaluation in ITS was summative, peer and self-evaluation did not have the same level of importance as hetero evaluation, and ITS focus was quantitative. All of this allowed us to conclude that the analyzed texts did not implement a holistic perspective and therefore evidenced the need to establish a framework for constructing an ITS using current technologies that integrate the mentioned variables.},

As an effective expression means of tourists' opinions, text mining of such data has big potential to inspire innovations for tourism practitioners. In the past decade, a variety of text mining techniques have been proposed and applied to tourism analysis to develop tourism value analysis models, build tourism recommendation systems, create tourist profiles, and make policies for supervising tourism markets. The successes of these techniques have been further boosted by the progress of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning. With the understanding of the complexity due to this diverse set of techniques and tourism text data sources, this work attempts to provide a detailed and up-to-date review of text mining techniques that have been, or have the potential to be, applied to modern tourism big data analysis. We summarize and discuss different text representation strategies, text-based NLP techniques for topic extraction, text classification, sentiment analysis, and text clustering in the context of tourism text mining, and their applications in tourist profiling, destination image analysis, market demand, etc. Our work also provides guidelines for constructing new tourism big data applications and outlines promising research areas in this field for incoming years.},
